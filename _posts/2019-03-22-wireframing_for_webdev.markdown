I attended yesterday a meet-up on Wireframing for Web Development, having pretty much no idea what it was about. So here is a quick summary of what I learned yesterday about wireframing. 

A wireframe, in Web Design, is a *visual guide that is used to represent the skeletal framework of a website*. Made simple it is the representation of what your website will look like. Designers have several choices to create their wireframe. They can use 
* Applications like Photoshop or Sketch
 
* Websites like mockflow or ninjamock

* Or the good-old-fashioned-but-efficient method of a pen and paper.

Designers want their wireframe to represent the finished product. Web Developers however, need a different type of wireframe. In front end development there is a common issue that can be easily solved with the proper wireframing. It has happened to more that one developer to write the HTML for a website and then realise that they need another level of division because the styling is not working out correctly with the current HTML structure. Such a change is laborious, time-consuming and not exactly risk-free. 

This is where wireframing comes in. It helps write the HTML code quickly, with the correct structure and does not require amendments. So where the designer needs a finished product, the developer will need a representation of what the website will look like so that they can split the whole page in blocks that will need to have a wrapper in the HTML code. 

There are 4 golden rules in wireframing for development: 
* Every single image must have a wrapper

* Elements must be grouped by type. To make it easier to see, you can use the same color to signal elements that will be at the same level in the HTML. For example, you can use green for the whole header, then for the whole content and for the whole footer. Inside of each of these you may need to highlight different levels again. 

* There needs to be a visual divide between elements: margins help visually divide elements

* When there is a change in the direction of the flow, all the elements that are in the same direction of flow must be in a wrapper together. For example, let's consider that the general flow of the website we are creating is vertical, from top to bottom. At one point on the website, there may be a need to have one part of the vertical flow that contains a series of photos that will flow horizontally, let's say from left to right. In these situations, you must have a wrapper for the whole horizontal part.

Thank you for ready and I hope it helps you plan your HTML better!
